*** Adventure Go! - Game Design ***
Specifications:
- Mobile Game (iOS / Android)

Game Mechanics:
- Party of adventurers that you send off to complete adventures
- Timer ticks down until adventure is complete
- On return; they gain experience and gear
- Experience assignment is based on character role and what they did during the adventure. It is not explicitly assigned by the player
- Gear however is assigned by the player and plays a role in determining in which areas a character gains experience
- Game starts and character group has no members but player has some starting gold
- Recruiting adventurers costs gold (higher the skill the greater the cost) but dismissal costs nothing
- Adventurers come in and out of the tavern so the recruitment page is not static
- Adventurers may die during adventures
? Resurrection of dead adventurers
? Adventurers age and their effectiveness decreases
- Adventurer health also needs to be monitored and may need to treat illness/injury/fatigue
- Damage can occur to individual body parts and loss of limbs can occur if enough damage is sustained
- Combat, experience and skill up is based on the Rune Quest / Ultima system
- Roles are assigned to adventurers (tank/healer/dps) these determine what the characters will do in an encounter
- Adventure events and outcome are generated and not impacted by the player
- Adventure outcome also has a story which is very detailed (inspiration from dwarf fortress)
- The Adventure list is generated based on group score
	? There will be 3 levels of adventures available; < = > OR there will be several in a list and assigned "danger scores"
	+ Harder the adventure the greater the reward in experience, gold and items
- Adventurer dynamics are important in relation to class and personality
	+ Squabbles / betrayals may occur between characters with conflicting personalities
	+ Decision points in the adventure are also determined by adventurer personalities
